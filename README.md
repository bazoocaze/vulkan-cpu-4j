# VulkanCpu4j

This a simple (ok, not so simple) software simulator for the Vulkan Graphics API written in Java v1.8.

## What it can do?

The primary objective is to port to Java and run all the tutorials at https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Introduction

Missing tutorials:

- Drawing a triangle
    - Presentation
    - Swapchain Recriation
- Vertex buffers
    - Staging buffer
    - Index buffer
- Uniform buffers
    - Descriptor pool and sets
- Texture mapping
- Depth buffering
- Loading models

### Prerequisites


### Target features

- Texture perspective correction
- Texture interpolation
- Pixel shader and vertex shader
- Optimized memory operations
- Optimized pipeline execution
- Optimized shader execution
- Optimized Windows form drawing
